# Network-Analysis-of-Game-of-Thrones
In this project, we will look at the character co-occurrence network and its evolution over the five books in R.R. Martin's hugely popular book series A Song of Ice and Fire (perhaps better known as the TV show Game of Thrones). Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, or Tyrion Lannister? Who is the most important character in Game of Thrones? Let's see what mathematics can tell us about this! We will look at how the importance of the characters changes over the books using different centrality measures.  This project uses a dataset parsed by Andrew J. Beveridge and Jie Shan which is available
